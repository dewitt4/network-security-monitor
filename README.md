# Network Security Monitor

A Python-based network security monitoring tool for detecting and logging suspicious network activity patterns.

## Features

- Real-time connection monitoring
- Detection of high-frequency connection attempts
- Unusual port access monitoring
- Suspicious pattern tracking
- Automated security reporting
- Detailed event logging

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-security-monitor
cd network-security-monitor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- socket
- logging

## Usage

Basic implementation:

```python
from network_security_monitor import NetworkSecurityMonitor

# Initialize the monitor
monitor = NetworkSecurityMonitor()

# Monitor a connection
monitor.monitor_connection(
    source_ip="192.168.1.100",
    dest_port=80,
    timestamp=datetime.datetime.now()
)

# Generate security report
report = monitor.generate_report()
print(report)

# Get suspicious activity summary
summary = monitor.get_suspicious_activity_summary()
print(summary)
```

## Configuration

The monitor tracks several types of suspicious patterns:
- Repeated authentication failures
- Connections to unusual ports (non-standard ports)
- High-frequency connection attempts (>5 requests/second)

Logs are stored in `security_monitor.log` with the following format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - LEVEL - MESSAGE
```

## Security Considerations

- This tool is for defensive monitoring only
- Ensure proper access controls for log files
- Regularly review and backup security reports
- Configure firewall rules to allow monitoring traffic
- Implement secure storage for IP addresses
